This Music Playlist Website is a static web project designed to provide users with a simple and intuitive platform for creating and viewing music playlists. Using basic HTML and CSS, the website enables users to input essential information such as song title, artist, genre, and lyrics, which are then displayed in a clean, organized layout. Following the structure of our wireframe, the site features a minimalist design with a focus on ease-of-use: a centered header, a clearly structured input form, and a playlist display area that updates dynamically with each submission. What sets our design apart from large-scale platforms like Spotify is its simplicity and accessibility. With no need for logins, downloads, or complex navigation, this site is perfect for users who are not highly literate in media or technology. The minimalist layout and intuitive flow make playlist creation straightforward and user-friendly. As a static website, it relies entirely on front-end code, making it lightweight and easy to deploy, ideal for demonstrating the power of well-organized, functional web design without the need for backend complexity.
